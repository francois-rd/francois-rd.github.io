I'm a graduate researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the University of Toronto supervised by [Frank Rudzicz](https://web.cs.dal.ca/~rudzicz/).

<p style="padding-left:5em;">Today, I'm wondering:</p>

<p style="padding-left:10em; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;">How do we build a world empowered by safe and reliable AI?</p>

## Research

Broadly, the theme of my graduate research is to improve the **reliability and safety** of large language models (LLMs). I'm passionately concerned about the **societal implication** and safe deployment of LLMs in real-world applications. In the long run, I'd like to see a world empowered with **safe and trustworthy AIs** that collaborate symbiotically with people.

In the short term, I'm passionately working towards improving the **grounding** and **reasoning** abilities of LLMs. Specifically, how do we ensure LLMs' understanding of the world is *grounded* in facts and data, rather than so-called [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence))? Futhermore, how do we ensure LLMs are carefully and correctly *reasoning* through these facts and data, rather than making spurious correlations and coming to faulty conclusions?

## Development

Alongside my graduate research, I developed [coma](/coma/), a Python library that I use to **rapidly prototype my all deep learning project pipelines**, from preprocessing, to training, to evaluation, and more. `coma` enables me to focus of producing impactful research, instead of getting bogged down in the minutiae of implementation details. I strongly encourage others to use this powerful tool.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I enjoy rock climbing &amp; bouldering, playing board games &amp; TTRPGs, reading books, playing drums, and exercising.
